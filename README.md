# .NET OpenApi Sample with Client

This is a sample project for how to generate OpenApi documentation which can be used to generate a client. 

The code in this repository is not ready for use in production! Especially the consumers are just proving that the generated client works.

This repository contains the code for the blog https://angelaev.wordpress.com/2020/12/12/rest-client-generation-for-asp-netcore-with-swashbuckle-and-autorest/
